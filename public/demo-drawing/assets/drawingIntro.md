# Drawing Section

In the following section, you will be asked to draw your own visualizations, with either your finger or a drawing tool (such as an Apple Pencil). There will first be a training task where you can explore the drawing interface. 

For your visualizations, feel free to keep your drawings abstract, exact numerical encoding of the data is not necessary.
